Turing - Mod 1 - Dog Party
Cohort 1906

I was given two prompts, screen shots of what we were to recreate with the following learning goals:
 - practice accurately building a comp
 - write well structured, semantic HTML
 - craft clean, DRY CSS
 - try out working with Javascript to interact with the DOM

I practiced using semantic HTML over divs to create a structured HTML page that can be used with multiple css pages.
